# This readme file describes data contained in the folder "aim_2" to create the Vaccination Improvement Potential (VIP) Index.

# The scripts are saved in two different parts. The first part is contained in the "01_extract_data" folder which prepares each of the individual datasets for analysis. The second batch of scripts is in "02_construct_index" which actually calculates the index and runs the validation.

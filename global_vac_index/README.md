Last updated by Francisco Rios Casas (frc2@uw.edu) on June 5, 2023

## The folders included in this repo reflect the aims of this project:
  
 * "aim_1": Conducting a missed opportunity for vaccination analysis in select countries.
 * "aim_2": Prepping data and final analyses to create the Vaccine Improvement Potential (VIP) Index.
 * "aim_3": Counterfactual analysis to estimate vaccination coverage and disease burden given different VIP Index results. 
 
##  The "Functions" folder contains functions that are sourced in other scripts to extract or prep data.
